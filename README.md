# Border_Crossing_Project

The following dataset can be found in the data file:

Border_Crossing_Entry_Data.csv - provides summary statistics for inbound crossings at the U.S.-Canada and the U.S.-Mexico border at the port level.

Cross border smuggling and human trafficking have been longstanding problems along the US-Mexico border. For Instance, the San Antonio tragedy where 52 people were found death in an abandoned trailer in Texas is one of the deadliest human trafficking on US soil. All 53 people were suspected to be migrants in hopes for searching for a better life in America. The route for those seeking the American dream have drastically become more dangerous due to many enforcement policies which has strengthened the border. This caused many migrants to seek many different dangerous pathways to cross the border.

That being said, I was wondering if the number of illegal border entry has decreased over the years due to the increase in enforcing policies and if it had an impact on the way people come into the US.
